The following is a list of the testing results:
You provided a single random-bit file: README.TXT
It is 0MB long. I divided this file 
into 1 sequences (each sequence is 512KB) and 
carried out LIL testing on them.

You have requested to generate the LIL curve pdf file. The resulting 
LIL curve file could be found in: SNAP.pdf

You have requested to carry out the snapShot testing. I generated
the snapShot curve in the file: SNAP.pdf. The statistical
distances are as follows (if the actual value is smaller than the expected
value, then your sequence passed the LIL test):
Total Variation: 
		4.6983(expected)	
		0.9884159176 (actual)
Hellinger distance: 
		3.3809(expected)	
		0.9446537060349711 (actual)
root-mean-square deviation: 
		0.3404(expected)	
		0.15500137448829382 (actual)

The LIL testing was carried out on 1 sequences. Each Sequence is
64KB long.
Thanks for using LIL testing tools. Please note that the obtained results
